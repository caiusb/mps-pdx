/*
 In this example we will transform a sequential implementation of a simple file
 indexer to a producer-consumer version of it. The indexer reads all the files from 
 one (or more) directories and produces a map between words and the files that contain them, 
 i.e. it generates a Map<String, Set<File>>. 

Steps:

 1. Find a good split between the "producer" part and the "consumer" part of
	the algorithm. The aim is to have a producer that crawls the directory structure and
	generates File objects (there are other split options, you can explore them if you
	like). The consumer feeds off the File objects and indexes them.
	Make the necessary transformations such that the "producer" part and the "consumer"
	part are separate (inner) classes. For now, don't worry about having more than 
	one producer and more than one consumer. Also, don't worry about how they are 
	interfaced. For this step you can use a simple data structure like a Set to get 
	all results from the "producer" and then send them to the "consumer". 

 2. The algorithm has a list of directories (as Files) as input. Make it such that 
	each file is processed by a different producer.

 3. The result of the consumer is, for now, a set of Files. Make it such that each
	file is processed by a separate "consumer".

 4. Make the "producers" work in parallel. You can choose any solution you like, i.e.
	simple Threads, Runnable tasks, thread pools, etc. Use a concurrent collection
	to it thread-safe.

 5. Make sure the producers finish before starting the consumers. Figure out a way 
	of stopping the producers when they have finished their work.

 6. Parallelize the consumers in a similar manner. Don't worry about running 
	the producers and consumers in parallel, for now. Make the consumers feed on the set given by
	the producers.

 7. Replace the Set<File> used to communicate between producers and consumers with a BlockingQueue.

 8. Make producers and consumers run in parallel. Make sure the application still terminates.
